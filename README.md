# Welcome to The Shell Shockers Hack, or Crackware
### These hacks provide abilities that will boost you through [shellshock.io](shellshock.io)
### Using these, you can get every skin in the game, all for free, disable the borders when you scope, and access a mod panel with various hacks including:  aimbot, Xray, tracers, and more!
### We can garuntee you that these hacks will work as we test them daily!
### For some information about setup, read this file for instructions.  
# Setup
### You are probably wondering how to setup the hacks right now!
### The hacks don't work like traditinal blooket hacks where you copy the code and paste it into the search bar after you type in `javascript:` or paste the code into the console
### Actually, it's very different from that!
### What you need to do for these hacks is:
#### First:  Download the Tampermonkey extension
#### Next:  Copy the code from the hack file that you decide to use.  Do this by highlighting the whole script, and pressing  `ctrl+c`
#### Then:  Click on the Tampermonkey extension and click on `Create a new script`
#### Afterwards:  Delete all the text in the coding box that appears and paste the code by pressing `ctrl+v`
#### Then:  Press `ctrl+s` to save your code and add it to your Tampermonkey sripts
#### Finally:  Go into Shell Shockers and watch your code in action!
### Note:  The Statefarm client has some extra steps!  Make sure to read the whole thing!
# Spoof Skins
### This script allows you to unlock every skin for free!  No golden eggs are needed!
### Wether it is a recently added skin that cost 100,000 golden eggs or and old skin that would cost $2, with this script, all of them are free and you can select from all of them when you open up your inventory.
# Disable Scope
### This script makes it so that when you scope `shift` the black borders will be removed, making it easier to spot enemies
# Statefarm Client
